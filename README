JtagKnocker
 Yet another JTAG finder and enumerator, targeted for the ST STM32 development 
 board. Why? Because I don't have an arduino and I don't want to buy dedicated 
 hardware.
 
 The documentation is currently breif, because I trust that you know how to 
 solder, connect wires and how various interfaces work. If you don't, you 
 probably shouldn't by trying to play with JTAG.

Requirements
 An ARM GCC toolchain. (arm-none-eabi- assumed by default) 
 
Building
 TBD
 
Usage
 Wire port D pins to each pin to test on the target board, starting at PD0.
 If you don't want to damage the target board and/or the STM32, place 330 ohm
 resistors in series with each connection to limit current to 10mA.
 
 Connect the development board to a serial interface and open up a 
 terminal. Hit Enter to get a prompt.
 
 The folling commands are valid:
  help			Displays this list of valid commands.
  scan			Scans for a JTAG interface. Will take some time.
  				Asks several questions before exceuting.
  chain			Once a valid interface is detected, scans the chain and
  				determines the properities of the devices.
  irenum (n)	Enumerates valid ir commands for device (n) on the chain.
  				(n) is assumed to be all devices if left out.
  config		Configure the JTAG port, if the interface pinout is known.
